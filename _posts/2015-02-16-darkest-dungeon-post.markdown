I don't get a lot of time these days to sit down and game like I would like, but soon after picking this game up, I found myself playing for several hours. For an early access game, this game seems to be pretty far a long. I noticed minor bugs, and found very little to complain about. 

The game is described as a "Challenging gothic roguelike turn-based RPG". I will sum it up by saying, it's a turn-based Diablo, on crack! I have no problem with that though. The game is a challenge, and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat anticipating what comes next.


I give it a 5 out 5, and it hasn't even technically released yet.
