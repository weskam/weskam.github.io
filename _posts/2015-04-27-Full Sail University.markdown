description: From October 2011 - January 2015, I spent my time as a student at <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu/degrees/online/mobile-development-bachelors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Full Sail University</a>. <br> <p>As a fresh programmer, I learned the necessary skills to become a well rounded mobile developer, and I also got the skills to ready me for the industry I would some day come to know. This wasn't always an easy task though. If you are unfamiliar with Full Sail University, the school teaches at a 2x faster rate than other universities. So as a fresh student unfamiliar to this style of learning, the "herd" gets cleared rather fast.</p> <br> <p>I know what it's like to work under extreme pressure with tight deadlines.</p> <br> <p>On February 6th 2015 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mobile Development.</p> <br> <p>Some of my projects can be found here:<a href="https://github.com/LULZwes/FSO-Classes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> FSO Repos</a></p>
