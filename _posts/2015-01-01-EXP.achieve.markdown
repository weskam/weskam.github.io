It consisted of an 8 week class. Taking the app from an idea, to a prototype, to a test phase and finally to a finished product.</p> <br> <p>The app itself is basically a todo list(goal tracker), but with an rpg type feel to it. Users can create goals, and mark them as complete. When users complete their goals, the users gain a little experience via a progress bar. This gives users a sense of "leveling up" for completing their goals/tasks. Not only can users gain experience and level up, they can also gain achievements through the Game Center.</p> <br> <p>I think what sets this app apart from all the other task apps, is that it has a social side to it. Users can share what they are doing via social media. The thing that really sets it apart though, is the groups feature, which allows users to complete goals as a team(think of a raid in World of Warcraft). To complete these group goals, you have to complete the goals together, or suffer when your group doesn't work as a team. When your group does work together, you are rewarded with tons of experience, and better achievements.</p> <br> <p><b>Source code available to potential clients only.</b></p> <br> Backend:<a href="https://www.parse.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Parse</a> <br> Libraries:<a href="https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> SWRevealViewController</a>
