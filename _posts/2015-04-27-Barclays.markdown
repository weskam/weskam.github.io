description: <p> Currently, I hold a position at <a href="http://www.barclays.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Barclays</a> as an iOS Developer in Dallas, TX. <br> </p> <br> <p>This (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/136463048@N06/7fKax6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ABSA Payments</a>) is an app I created from scratch that helps users pay through sending a message. To initiate a send payment, the user will type "#send, or #sendto" It would fall in comparison with how facebook allows its users to send payments through their messaging app.<br> <p>
