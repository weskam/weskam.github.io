<h3>This site</h3>
<p>This site is a blog, obviously! It will be a place for me to share things I care about with the world. You can expect to find a lot of nerdy related topics here. It will include projects I'm working on, code related issues, gaming, but all-in-all, just a bunch of randomness. If you like what you see, subscribe via the RSS link. If there are topics you would like to see, or just have questions, fell free to email me.</p>
