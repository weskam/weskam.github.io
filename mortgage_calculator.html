                      <h4>Launch Screen</h4>
                      <p>
                        This View consisted of an ImageView along with four button. The ImageView had a timed animation that would switch between various images. When an image was pressed, the user would be navigated to the "Mortgage Help Videos", and would begin playing the correct video.
                        The Buttons had static data that would be passed to the "Mortagage Calculater".
                      </p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/001.png" alt="project name"/>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Mortgage Help Videos</h4>
                     <p></p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/002.png" alt="project name"/>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Mortgage Calculator</h4>
                     <p>Another developer wrote the code for this View. I had little code to write here. I only fixed some of the cosmetics.
                       Pressing "Continue" takes you to the "Morgage Products" View.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/003.png" alt="project name"/>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Mortgage Products</h4>
                     <p>
                       This is where the "magic" happens. Filter and Compare, are buttons. When Filter was pressed, the buttons would animate out away from each other. Below you can see a list of different mortages.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/004.png" alt="project name"/>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Mortgage Products</h4>
                     <p>
                       I wrote a feature that would aloud the user to sort through a number of different mortgages.
                       The way the mortgages sort, is similar to how you would sort through items on Amazon, or Zillow. I wanted to keep it easy for the user to understand.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/005.png" alt="project name"/>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Mortgage Products</h4>
                     <p>
                       As the user pressed a "Fixed Period" box, the user would start seeing the mortages change based on year. The user also had the option to check "Mortgage Type", that would allow to filter by year.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/006.png" alt="project name"/>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Mortgage Products</h4>
                     <p>
                       If the user wanted to compare different mortgages, all they had to do is press the compare button. This feature never was finished. It got killed before code was even written. Pressing on a table, would navigate you to the "Summary" View.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/007.png" alt="project name"/>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Summary</h4>
                     <p>
                       This View gives the user a detail list of the mortgage that was selected. If the user was pleased with their selection all they would have to do is press continue.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/008.png" alt="project name"/>
                     <br>
                     <h4>Confirmation</h4>
                     <p>
                      After pressing continue on the previous screen, the user would be preseneted with their confirmation. This was static, and never actually sent out real data.
                     </p>
                     <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/projects/project1/009.png" alt="project name"/>
